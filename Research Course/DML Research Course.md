# How to get started

## How to use the Humanities Servers
1. Get access to the Humanities Server, ask [Dr. Woolhouse](woolhouse@mcmaster.ca) or [Jotthi](bansalj@mcmaster.ca).
2. Install VPN ([link](http://www.mcmaster.ca/uts/network/vpn/)) to access the server without being connected to McMaster's network.
3. ssh into the server. `ssh user_name@woolhouse-g.humanities.mcmaster.ca`.
