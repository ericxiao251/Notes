# TF - KLD

Paper and code --> [github](https://github.com/jiyfeng/tfkld)

## Abstract
We describe 3 ways in which labeled data can improve the accuracy of these approaches on paraphrase classification:
1. New discriminative term-weighting metric called `TF-KLD`.
2. Using latent representation from matrix factorization as features in a classificaiont algorithm substantially improves accuracy.
3. Combine latent features with fine-grained n-gram overlap features.
