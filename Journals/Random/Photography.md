### AV: Aperture Priority
* User manually chooses the aperture (size of opening of lens), while the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed.
* Expressed as a fraction, smaller number bigger the opening.
* AV is great for situations where there is plenty of light.
* Avoid AV in low light situations without a flash.
* Determines how much light you let in and how in focus things are.

### TV: Shutter Priority
* User manually chooses a shutter speed (exposure), while camera automatically adjusts the aperture.
* Expressed in fraction of a second.
* TV mode is good for when you hitting a specific shutter speed.
    * Example, at a sporting event, you might want to keep shutter speed locked. If not capturing motion will be blurry.
* TV mode is great for taking videos.
    * When you’re shooting a video, you want to lock in your shutter speed for a consistent look, but don’t want to constantly be fielding with your settings to et the right exposure.
* TV is good for situation where depth doesn’t matter.
    * For example, if you’re taking a picture of a family, something extra light comes in and people in the photo will be out of focus.

ISO: Sensitivity of your sensor
* Higher the number, the more sensitive your camera is to the light coming in, at 400 it’s twice as sensitive as it would be at 200.

Pro tips:
* Use live view to learn the current settings.  
* Adjust values in this sequence:  
AV —> TV —> ISO
* Shutter speed should be less than your lens, unless it has IS.
