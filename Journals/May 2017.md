	* Finish sales views models
* **Accomplishments**:
* **Feedback**:
	* For fast debugging, shows only the keys that don't match...
```python
        import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
        for i, row in enumerate(sorted(actual)):
            for key in row.keys():
                if row[key] != sorted(expected)[i][key]:
                    print('%s --> %s != %s' % (key, row[key], expected[i][key]))
```

##### Friday May 13, 2017:
* **Feedback**:
	* check `.json_schema` to see if columns are `nullable`. Only works if they are not raw data files, ie from longboat vs outputs from jobs.g


#### Saturday May 14, 2017
* **Feedback**:
	* For a lot of the `NLP` libraries you will need to download the langauge libraries.

Spacy --> [github issue](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/174)
```python
# python -m spacy.en.download --force all
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
doc = nlp(u'This is a sentence.')

# pip3 install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_md-1.2.0/en_core_web_md-1.2.0.tar.gz
import spacy
import en_core_web_md

nlp = en_core_web_md.load()
doc = nlp(u'This is a sentence.')
```

NLTK --> [library edits](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)

```python
# python -m nltk.downloader all

import nltk
nltk.download('all')

When dev doesn't work try the **rebase dance**:
* rebase
* dev up
* dev down
* reset-railgun


##### Sunday May 21, 2017

How to rebase like a boss.
`cw -> s -> ESC` then `.`
1) `cw -> s -> ESC` deletes **picked** and replaces it with **s**
2) `.` repeats your last command.

Better than
`daw` -> `.` and then `s` -> `.`
this is twice as slow.

ReportifyDB:  

`metrics` are fields we aggregate into sums, averages, etc.

##### Wednesday May 24, 2017

Decimals in Spark are gross...
1. When you cast to another datatype:  
	DO:  
	```python
    from pyspark.sql import types as T

    df['col_name].cast(T.DecimalType(20, 2))
    ```  
    DON'T:  
    ```python
    df['col_name'].cast('Decimal(20, 2)')
    ```  
2. Don't have to have same precious to do multiplications and divisions.

Same error message, different root caueses...

* This fix was column names weren't matching, check `.json` for names.
Some models still depended on `total_price` and `total_price_usd`, and I removed * it, lele.
